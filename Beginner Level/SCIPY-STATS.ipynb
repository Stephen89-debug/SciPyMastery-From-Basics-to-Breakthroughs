This magical module in SciPy offers you everything you need to analyze, visualize, and make sense of data in the **simplest yet most powerful ways**.\n",

    "1. **Tools to Summarize Data** ‚Äì Need the average or median? Done! Want to see how much variation or spread your data has? Sorted!\n",
    "2. **Probability Distributions Galore** ‚Äì You get access to every kind of distribution you can imagine‚Äînormal, binomial, Poisson, and more. \n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Testing** ‚Äì Curious to see if two groups are different? Or if a variable truly affects your outcome? `scipy.stats` is your best friend here.\n",
