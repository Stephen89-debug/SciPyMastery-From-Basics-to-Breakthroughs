    "### **What is `scipy.integrate`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, integration is like calculating the area under a curve, right? Matlab: If you have a function, and you want to find out the total area from one point to another on its curve, you integrate that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in **SciPy**, we have a module called **`integrate`**, which is *very* useful for solving both simple and complex integration problems. Whether it's single-variable integrals, multi-variable integrals, or solving differential equationsâ€”this is the toolkit you need!"
