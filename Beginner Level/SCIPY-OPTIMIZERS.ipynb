    "\n",
    "SciPy is a Python library that provides easy-to-use tools for optimization through the `scipy.optimize` module. With this module, we can solve optimization problems in a very simple and structured way.\n",

    "### Starting Point: The `minimize()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **most basic** function in SciPy for optimization is `minimize()`. This function helps us find the minimum of a mathematical function. You can think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have a function \\( f(x) \\), and you want to find the value of `x` where this function gives the smallest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective function**: This is the function that you want to minimize or maximize.\n",
    "- **Initial guess**: You start with an initial guess (value of `x`), and SciPy will improve this guess iteratively.\n",
    "- **Minimum**: The point where the function gives the lowest value."
